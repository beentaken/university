                                THE GAME OF LIFE
                             WRITTEN BY IAN SHARPE


      The Game Of Life was invented by the mathematician John Conway and 
      first reached a wide public when it was written up in Scientific 
      American in 1970 or thereabouts In those days it was mostly played on
      squared paper. Nowadays computers take all the hard work out of this 
      fascinating invention. To some it's nothing more than a toy; to others 
      it and related cellular automata are subjects for serious study.

      In this implementation the screen is divided into a grid of cells 40 
      wide by 24 deep. A cell may be live (red) or dead (white). You begin by 
      creating the first generation of live cells, or seed. Use the cursor 
      keys to move the cursor, and the spacebar to toggle a cell between 
      live and dead.

      Press [Return], and the program will quickly create successive 
      generations of cells. A new generation is created by scanning every 
      cell and counting up the number of live neighbours. A neighbour is 
      classed as the eight cells that border horizontally, vertically and 
      diagonally.

      The cell under scrutiny is live or dead in the next generation 
      according to the following rules:

      * None or one live neighbour: Dies of loneliness.
      * Two live neighbours: Stays in the same state as it is now.
      * Three live neighbours: Lives in the next generation.
      * Four or more live neighbours: Dies of suffocation.

      When every cell on the screen has had its state assessed and made live 
      or dead according to the rules, the new generation is complete and the 
      process repeats.
